## About me(_diafinger_)

Born and raised in a small town in the west of Germany, I moved to Hamburg to study Media Information Science (Medieninformatik) at the FH Wedel. With my previous experience of building simple websites, I was able to land jobs as a student programmer at AOL and smaller companies.

After a year long break in which I studied in Bristol (UK) and lived and traveled in and around Vancouver (Canada), I returned to Hamburg to finish my Diploma (closer to the Master than the Bachelor degree) and start my career. I stayed there until the end of 2012 when I moved to Barcelona (Spain), a great place to enjoy life.

During my professional career I worked for agencies, a browser games company, an internet translation company <https://tolingo.com>, a large social network <https://xing.com>, a web development bootcamp <https://www.ironhack.com>, a bank <https://solaris.bank>, and have been self-employed.

While my role was usually that of a web developer, I also developed applications, designed and balanced the game mechanics of a football manager and taught and mentored aspiring web developers.

Previously, I worked with languages like Perl, PHP, Java and ActionScript. But since discovering Ruby in 2010 I have worked exclusively with Ruby - and all the other languages and DSLs that come with Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications.

I like Ruby so much that I started teaching it to beginners. First through RailsGirls workshops in Hamburg and Barcelona (where I also organized both). Later through periodical meetups in Barcelona and as a (paid) teacher and mentor in the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. I am also one of the organizers of [Barcelona on Rails](https://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-on-Rails), the local Ruby User Group.

From 2017 on, I worked 18 months as a freelancer for solarisBank - a newly founded bank and tech company that offers financial products strictly over APIs. Their main office is in Berlin and I worked fully remote from Barcelona. Afterwards I have been back for a few weeks at XING Barcelona to update their oldest and largest Ruby on Rails app to the latest Rails version 5.2, before joining Cookpad remotely, who have their (beautiful) office in Bristol, UK. In the four months with Cookpad I experienced a very dynamic working style where each team would start multiple small experiments each week. Small tweaks to UI, texts, features. Anything that could be measured and evaluated. Successful changes were kept and explored further, unsuccessful ones removed. In 2019 I worked on a project for VersaCommerce, a small e-commerce provider based in Hannover, Germany.

> At the moment I'm on the lookout for interesting projects for 2019. I did not sign a contract yet.


## In case you want to hire me

I enjoy working in small companies with small development teams. This setup promises light processes and demands independent workers. People have to show initiative and should be willing and able to make decisions. At the same time it enables transparency and clear communication structures.

I do consider myself to be a product developer thinking of all parts of an implementation and not only 'my code'. I prefer to write simple, maintainable code and to find a good, pragmatic solution, instead of a complex one. When layers of abstractions or optimizations become necessary, they can be added at the right moment.

I am a strong communicator. Spreading information and connecting people comes natural to me. I do push my colleagues to share more. Be it through the group chat or in pull request descriptions or by creating new tickets. When I am in the office, I use the opportunity to connect with people outside of my team to learn more about the business in general. When I am remote, video chats help discussing complex matters.

I am happy to work in a fully remote position. At home in Barcelona I have a great setup with standing desk, 4k screen, 200 MBit fibre connection and a sunny balcony. Now that summer is approaching I want to take advantage of living in Spain with a ‘Bulli’ and work [besides a beach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediafinger/mediafinger.github.io/master/bulli_beach.jpg title="Playa de las Hurnas, Spain") or [in the mountains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediafinger/mediafinger.github.io/master/bulli_montsec.jpg title="Montsec, Spain") from time to time - when there is a fast internet connection available.

> Feel free to offer me _competitively compensated_ **remote** roles. I am registered as an autónomo (freelancer) in Spain.
